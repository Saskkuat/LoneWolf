Thousands of years passed before the Ice Barbarians migrated here from the Uncharted Void, claiming Ikaya for themselves. Their leaders, the ‘Brumalmarc’ as they are called, have ruled over Kalte from the safe shelter of this fortress ever since.</p><p>You have covered nearly five miles when Irian suddenly points to the west. ‘There … over there. I’m sure I saw something.’</p><p>You halt and strain your eyes to try to identify something unusual in the monotonous landscape of ice and snow.</p><p>‘Look over there!’ shouts Fenor, pointing towards a ridge less than a mile away. Two fur-clad warriors are standing on top of a large slab of ice. They are staring at you.</p><p>‘Ice Barbarians!’ whispers Irian, his voice shaking with fear. ‘If they beat us to Ikaya, we’re as good as dead.’</p><p>You are still ten miles from the ice fortress and less than two hours of daylight remain.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to ignore the Ice Barbarians and press on to Ikaya, <a href="sect327.htm">turn to 327</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to attack them and try to prevent them warning others, <a href="sect307.htm">turn to 307</a>.</p></body></html>
