The snow clogs your eyes and your lips crack and bleed, but by midday you reach the edge of the basin. Irian and Dyceâ€™s sledge arrives at the ice wall first and they eagerly encourage you onwards.</p><p>Without any warning, a great crack appears between the two sledges, opening with a tremendous roar, until you are faced by a huge dark crevasse. Frantically you pull on the reins but it is too late to prevent your Kanu-dog team from disappearing into the void. Your sledge is left balancing on the edge of the crevasse, while the team of howling Kanu-dogs dangle helplessly in their harnesses below you. Very carefully, you risk a glance into the chasm. You see that the first two dogs have broken free and dropped over one-hundred-and-fifty feet to a ledge below. One of them appears to be dead. The other is badly injured and whimpers beside the still body of its comrade. Suddenly, a shudder jolts the sledge and you gasp with fright.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to crawl with Fenor to the rear of the sledge, <a href="sect146.htm">turn to 146</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you decide to try to leap clear of the sledge onto the cracked ice, <a href="sect29.htm">turn to 29</a>.</p></body></html>
