It is a powerful captain of the undead, and is immune to normal weapons. An agent of the Darklords, it has been sent to kill Vonotar for his failure at the Battle of Holmgulf. Now free from the pentagram that imprisoned it, the Helghast can complete its mission and return to the rewards and praise of its masters.</p><p>You cry out in terror as the Helghastâ€™s fingers rend and burn at your throat. But your cries fade unheeded in the dark passage; only death will end your agony.</p><p class="deadend">Your life and your mission end here.</p></body></html>
