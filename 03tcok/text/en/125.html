You eventually reach a vast ice vault, the centre of which is filled with a lake. The frozen surface is very thin, and the water beneath it looks dark and deep. You kneel at the edge of the lake, peering into its mysterious depths. Suddenly you see a large black shape pass close to the surface. There is something alive beneath the iceâ€”and it is enormous. Then behind you, you hear the growls of a Kalkoth. The noise is coming from the tunnel. There is only one other exit from this vault which is on the other side of the frozen lake.</p><figure>
