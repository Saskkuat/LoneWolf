They attack you one at a time, and you must fight each of them to the death.</p><p class="combat">Doomwolf 1: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 15   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 24</p><p class="combat">Doomwolf 2: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 14   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 23</p><p class="combat">Doomwolf 3: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 14   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 20</p><p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect161.htm">turn to 161</a>.</p></body></html>
