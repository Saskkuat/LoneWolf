Peeling off your thick jacket, you wind it around your left forearm. You can now use your padded arm to shield yourself from one deadly head as you strike at the other. This creature is immune to Mindblast.</p><figure>

Instead, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If the number you pick is 0–8, the Javek has sunk its fangs harmlessly into your padded arm, and you may continue the combat without losing any <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p><p>However, if you pick a 9, the fangs have punctured your arm. The venom of a Javek is the most powerful natural poison in all of Magnamund. In a few seconds your heart stops, and your paralysed body falls into the abyss.
