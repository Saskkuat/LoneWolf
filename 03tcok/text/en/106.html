The fur-clad warriors are armed with vicious bone swords, each encrusted with sharp teeth along the blade. Even in the surprise of their attack you notice the strangeness of their eyes: they are completely white and have no pupils at all.</p><p>They attack you as if they were possessed of one mind, lunging at you simultaneously and dodging your blows in unison.

They are immune to Mindblast.</p><p class="combat">Ice Barbarians: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 19   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 36</p><p class="choice">You may evade at any time by crawling back into the chamber and escaping by the north passage. <a href="sect145.htm">Turn to 145</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect338.htm">turn to 338</a>.</p></body></html>
