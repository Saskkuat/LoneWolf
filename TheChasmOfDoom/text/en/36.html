<html><body><p>The Warhounds lope towards you at an unnerving speed. You can see their great red-lipped jaws clearly and hear the clacking of their fangs. You fight to control your breathing, to concentrate all your warrior skills, for you must dispatch the Warhounds quickly and with precision if you are to avoid being torn to pieces. Two dogs, faster than their brothers, break free of the pack and close upon you. They leap simultaneously, their slavering jaws spread wide for attack. You dive forward and roll, striking at their bellies from beneath as they pass above. Both howl with rage and pain and tumble lifeless to the ground. You are back on your feet as the next Warhound attacks.</p><p class="combat">Vassagonian Warhound: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 17   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 25</p><p class="choice">If you win this combat in 3 rounds or less, <a href="sect155.htm">turn to 155</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you win the combat in more than 3 rounds, <a href="sect277.htm">turn to 277</a>.</p></body></html>
