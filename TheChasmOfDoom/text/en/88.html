Covering your mouth and nose you step back and raise your weapon in readiness to strike, for the creature is slithering towards you at a frightening pace. Your men rain blows upon its gaping jaws, but their blades barely scratch the creature’s glistening grey skin before they are snatched and swallowed whole. Relentlessly the Stoneworm advances until it is upon you. You cannot evade it and you must fight the creature to the death. It is immune to Mindblast.</p><p class="combat">Stoneworm: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 15   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 38</p><p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect321.htm">turn to 321</a>.</p></body></html>
