There is an explosion of searing white flame. The heat scorches your face, and you are thrown to the floor. You lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p><p>You stare in horror as Barraka, his arm torn from his body by the blast, staggers backwards across the temple. He has been blinded by the fire, and he claws at his sightless eyes with his remaining hand. You watch in silence as he stumbles through the black skull doors and plummets into Maakengorge, swallowed up by the Chasm of Doom.</p><figure>
