You roll aside in time to avoid a deadly thrust and spring to your feet to face your assailant.

You cannot evade combat and must fight him to the death.</p><p class="combat">Vassagonian Warrior: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 18   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 25</p><p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect24.htm">turn to 24</a>.</p></body></html>
