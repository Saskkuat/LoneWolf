Suddenly a bolt of lightning shoots from the staff and hits you square in the chest. You lose 6 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Gasping with pain, you knock the old man aside and run up the steep staircase towards daylight. You are halfway up the stairs when he fires another bolt at you.</p><p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.</p><p>If the number is 0–5, the bolt misses you and shatters part of the wall.</p><p>If the number is 6–9, then you have been hit in the back and lose a further 4 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p><p>If you survive, you stagger out into the daylight and curse your bad luck. It was only by an unlucky chance you discovered the secret temple of a sect of evil druids. You are very lucky to have escaped with your life. You quickly rejoin the path which now disappears over the hill.</p><figure>
