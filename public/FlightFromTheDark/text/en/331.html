It is approximately seven feet in height and just over ten feet wide. As you get closer, you can feel a slight breeze coming from the inky blackness. If the other end of this tunnel emerges on the far side of the hill, it could save you many hours of difficult climbing. But it could also harbour unknown danger.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to enter the tunnel, <a href="sect170.htm">turn to 170</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you would prefer to climb the hillside, <a href="sect280.htm">turn to 280</a>.</p></body></html>
