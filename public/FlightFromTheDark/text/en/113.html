You recognize the plants to be Laumspur, a rare and beautiful herb much prized for its healing properties.</p><p>Kneeling down, you pick a handful of Laumspur and place it in your Backpack. You may eat this herb to regain lost <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Each Meal of Laumspur will restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points, and you have gathered enough for two such Meals. Closing your pack, you continue your mission.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to head northeast, <a href="sect347.htm">turn to 347</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to head east, <a href="sect295.htm">turn to 295</a>.</p><section id="footnotes">

<p> Each Meal of Laumspur may be consumed when prompted for a Meal, in which case it fulfils the Meal requirement in addition to restoring 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. Laumspur may also be consumed at any other time to restore <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> without having any significance as a Meal.</p>
