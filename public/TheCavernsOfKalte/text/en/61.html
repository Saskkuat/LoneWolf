Suddenly you hear the dull tone of a stone bell as it tolls in a watchtower high above the fortressâ€”the alarm bell. The balcony and the courtyard below are completely deserted, except for a wind sledge near to the courtyard gate.</p><p>You decide to take a chance, and descend a flight of steps to discover that the sledge is loaded with food and equipment from Ljuk.
