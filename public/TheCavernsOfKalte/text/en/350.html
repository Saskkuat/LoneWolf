You now stand upon the Ljuk ice shelf at a point less than half a mile from where the <cite>Cardonal</cite> lies at anchor. Loi-Kymar and Vonotar are close by, both shivering in the chill morning air. Within minutes you are sighted by the ship’s lookout and a longboat is dispatched. As a wriggling Vonotar is hoisted unceremoniously aboard the <cite>Cardonal</cite> and deposited in the brig the captain is the first to congratulate you on your skill and daring.</p><p>‘But how did you manage to return so quickly?’ he asks incredulously. ‘We were not expecting you for another ten days.’</p><p>‘Let us say,’ interrupts Loi-Kymar, ‘that the wisdom of the Kai and the lore of the Magicians’ Guild can surpass the limitations of even time itself.’</p><p>A puzzled expression crosses the captain’s face, but it is gradually replaced by a smile as he begins to understand the magician’s curious answer.</p><p>Your journey to Anskaven is swift, but you are saddened by your memories of the brave guides that were left behind. Your arrival in the port is greeted by an anxious crowd. They fear that your early return is a sign of your mission’s failure. When the news of Vonotar’s capture becomes known, your warrior skills are required once again; this time in the defence of your enemy against the seething mob of outraged Sommlending that assault Anskaven gaol.

He is led away in silence to the deepest chamber of the Guildhall, wherein lies the Daziarn: a portal of total darkness, the door of an eternal prison from which there can be no escape.
