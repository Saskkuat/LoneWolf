Your eye follows a line of tall pillars leading towards a sacrificial altar set into an alcove in the northern wall. Upon this altar lies a strange statue, which seems to be carved from smooth white stone. At its head and feet, black staves rest upright in holes bored into the altar stone.</p><p>To the left of the altar there is a darkened archway, through which a flight of stairs ascends out of view.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to cross the temple and advance towards the staircase, <a href="sect60.htm">turn to 60</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to cross the temple floor by stepping only on the quartz flagstones, <a href="sect168.htm">turn to 168</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to cross the temple by stepping only on the granite flagstones, <a href="sect244.htm">turn to 244</a>.</p></body></html>
