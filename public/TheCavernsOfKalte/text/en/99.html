It recognizes the power you wield, a power that can bring about its eternal destruction. In desperation, it attacks you with a powerful Mindblast. Unless you possess the Kai Discipline of Mindshield, you must lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points for every round of combat that you fight this creature. The Helghast is immune to Mindblast, but as one of the undead it is especially vulnerable to the Sommerswerd. Be sure to double all <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points it loses due to the power of the Sommerswerd.</p><p class="combat">Helghast: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 22   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 30</p><p class="choice">If you win the combat, <a href="sect230.htm">turn to 230</a>.</p></body></html>
