<html><body><p>The tunnel is short and soon leads you to a small cavern. In the centre of the cavern lie two corpses, both human. In spite of the freezing temperature, they are badly decomposed; they have obviously been dead for a very long time. Both are attired in furs and one still has a flint dagger grasped in his hand. From the position of the bodies, it looks as if they killed each other in a desperate fight.</p><figure>
