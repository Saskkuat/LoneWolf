It has been six days since you left Holmgard and you are still 200 miles from Port Bax.</p><p>You are in the loft of a very large coach station. A group of green-clad men have arrived and have started to clean out one of the coaches. You overhear one of them say that the coach leaves for Port Bax at one oâ€™clock this afternoon and that the journey will take seven days.</p><p>You are hungry and must eat a Meal here or lose 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points.</p><p class="choice">After the Meal, if you decide to approach the coachmen and ask to buy a ticket for the journey to Port Bax, <a href="sect136.htm">turn to 136</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you would rather descend the ladder to the street outside, <a href="sect238.htm">turn to 238</a>.</p></body></html>
