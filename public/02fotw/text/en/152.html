The galleons of the Durenese war fleet lie at anchor in the harbour, impatiently awaiting the order to set sail for Sommerlund. On board each ship are many brave soldiers from the mountain kingdom, a tough army of skilled warriors, eager to face the Darklords in battle. Each man has sworn to avenge their besieged allies, or die in the attempt.</p><p>You are to sail back to Holmgard aboard the flagship <cite>Durenor</cite>, a warship whose great curving prow and tall masts emphasize its sheer power and strength.

The domes of Port Bax are now merely dots on the horizon.</p><p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.</p><p class="choice">If the number you have picked is 0–3, <a href="sect216.htm">turn to 216</a>.</p><p class="choice">If the number is 4–6, <a href="sect49.htm">turn to 49</a>.</p><p class="choice">If the number is 7–9, <a href="sect193.htm">turn to 193</a>.</p></body></html>
