<p> The Sommerswerd is a weapon-like Special Item. The +10 <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> bonus referred to for Weaponskill is a combination of the +8 <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> that the Sommerswerd grants naturally and +2 for Weaponskill with Short Sword, Sword, or Broadsword (as each of them grant proficiency with the Sommerswerd). It is not an additional bonus. When used in combat, treat it like a one-handed sword, regardless of Weaponskill bonus. The text or footnotes will always remind you to double your enemyâ€™s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point loss if it is undead.</p>
