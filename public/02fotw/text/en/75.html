The fee is 10 Gold Crowns.’</p><p class="choice">If you wish to sign the forms and purchase a White Pass, mark it on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> and <a href="sect142.htm">turn to 142</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you do not have enough money or do not wish to purchase the pass, leave this office and return to the hall by <a href="sect318.htm">turning to 318</a>.</p></body></html>
