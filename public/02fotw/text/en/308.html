<html><body><p>A sailor called Sprogg sits beside you and explains the rules of the game ‘Portholes’. First he shows you two diamond-shaped dice made of red glass. Each die has ten sides and they are numbered 0–9. Each player rolls both dice and adds the numbers together (0 = zero). If anyone throws two 0s, they shout ‘portholes’ and automatically win.</p><p>Each player stakes 3 Gold Crowns per throw. There are two other players in the game and they all place their stake money into a hat before the dice are rolled.</p><p>Pick two numbers from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> for each of the other two players, and note these scores down. Now pick two numbers from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> for yourself. If your total is higher than the other players, you win 6 Gold Crowns. If either of the other players beat your score, you lose 3 Gold Crowns. You may leave the game at any time, but you must stop playing if you lose all your Crowns (bad luck!).</p><p class="choice">When you finally decide to leave, you may return to your cabin by <a href="sect197.htm">turning to 197</a>.</p></body></html>
