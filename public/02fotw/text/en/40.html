As each day passes, you despair for your besieged countrymen of Holmgard and pray that they have enough strength to resist the Darklords until you return.</p><p>Every day of your reluctant exile you devote long periods to exercise and meditation. You are also visited by a Durenese herbwarden called Madin Rendalim, who is famous throughout the Lastlands for his knowledge and skill in the healing arts. He restores all the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points you may have lost so far on your adventure, and he gives you a potent Laumspur potion that will restore 5 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points if swallowed after combat. (Mark this under Backpack Items on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.)</p><p>He is also the bearer of some sad news. The body of Lord-lieutenant Rhygar was found in the forest near to the entrance to Tarnalin. He was killed by Helghast.</p><p class="choice">If you have the Kai Discipline of Sixth Sense, <a href="sect97.htm">turn to 97</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you do not possess this skill, <a href="sect242.htm">turn to 242</a>.</p></body></html>
