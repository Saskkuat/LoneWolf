Like a diamond set in the green velvet shore, the towers of the city glimmer in the pale light of a waxing moon. To the north is the harbour and the formidable war fleet of the Durenese navy. To the east, beyond the moss-covered city wall, stretches the Forest of Durenor. And there, on the crest of a hill, stands a castle tall and proud, the crowning glory of this beautiful port.</p><p>You enter Port Bax through an unguarded gate in the green city wall, and make your way through the darkening streets towards the harbour.</p><p>As you turn into a tree-lined avenue, you notice the wide stone steps of a domed building to your right. You stop to read the brass plaque.</p><p>Despite the late hour, the main doors are open.</p><p class="choice">If you have the Kai Discipline of Tracking, <a href="sect252.htm">turn to 252</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to enter the city hall, <a href="sect84.htm">turn to 84</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to continue on your way towards the harbour, <a href="sect191.htm">turn to 191</a>.</p></body></html>
