Your experience of Ragadorn so far makes you suspicious of the dark liquid and you politely refuse her offer. As you push the steaming mug away, she notices the Seal on your finger.</p><p>‘What a magnificent ring! Is it for sale?’ she asks, her eyes lighting up with excitement. You tell her firmly that it is not but she will not accept your refusal. She offers you any choice of the hundreds of potions that fill the glass cabinets behind her counter. As you turn to leave, she offers you 40 Gold Crowns.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to accept her offer, <a href="sect165.htm">turn to 165</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to leave the shop, <a href="sect186.htm">turn to 186</a>.</p><section id="footnotes">

<p> To preserve continuity, if you no longer possess the Seal of Hammerdal, you leave the shop immediately. Turn to <a href="sect186.htm">Section 186</a>.</p>
