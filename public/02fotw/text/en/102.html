Usually it is alive with the traffic of wagons and people to and from Port Bax. But as you enter, you find it deserted except for an overturned fruit cart. The road that disappears into the torchlit tunnel is empty and quiet.</p><p>As you walk along the paved road, you get an uneasy feeling that perhaps the Helghast have arrived at Tarnalin before you.
