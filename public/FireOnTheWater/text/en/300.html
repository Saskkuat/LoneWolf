He seems to think that you are a refugee trying to stowaway on board. But when you shout that you are Lone Wolf and you were ambushed by an impostor at the tavern, the ladder is soon lowered again. As you climb over the side of the ship, you are met by a tall man in a gold-braided uniform. His face is almost totally covered by a shock of bright red hair and a bright red beard.</p><p>‘Haul anchor!’ he booms. The crew spring into action as if their very lives depended on it.</p><p>The captain ushers you below to his cabin where he pours two glasses of wanlo, a strong spirit. His face shows concern as you tell him what has happened.</p><p>‘There is evil treachery at work and the enemy already has plans afoot to thwart your quest,’ he begins when you’ve told your tale. ‘It seems that you have lost the element of surprise—and I have lost a courageous first mate. Let us only hope that the voyage to Durenor be swift and safe.’</p><figure>
