You realize that this must be an escape shaft from the Maaken Mines, for they honeycomb the foothills of this mountain range. If only you can locate a major tunnel, you may find a path all the way to Ruanon itself. You kneel at the edge and peer down into the gloom. There is such an overwhelming smell of dampness and decay that you decide to send your lightest man down the ladder to check whether it is still secure.
