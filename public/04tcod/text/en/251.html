You order three of your men to scout ahead, for you know the notorious reputation this forested highway has for sudden bandit ambushes; the densely packed trees lining the road could easily conceal an army of robbers. Before the scouts gallop away, you order them to report anything unusual they may find on the road ahead.</p><p>Within an hour, you arrive at a junction where a track from the east meets the main highway. Abandoned at the side of the road is a burnt-out wagon. You sense that something is wrong; your scouts should have reported this wagon long before you found it, and your men are worried by what may have happened to them. You know that you dare not continue your ride in case you fall into an ambush. You decide to rest at the junction and wait for the return of your scouts. Six hours later, as the sun slowly rises over the eastern tree-line, your scouts have still not returned.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to search the highway ahead, <a href="sect175.htm">turn to 175</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to examine the burnt-out wagon, <a href="sect38.htm">turn to 38</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to explore the eastern track, <a href="sect293.htm">turn to 293</a>.</p></body></html>
