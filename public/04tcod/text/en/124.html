He is cut down by an arrow, but not before he has let loose from his staff a guttering ball of flame. It cartwheels across the plain and explodes with a tremendous roar, hurling the bodies of defenders and shattered barricade high into the air. Through the cloud of dust and debris, you can see a line of enemy cavalry charging across the plain. They wear tall plumed helmets of polished steel and breastplates of deepest crimson. In the wake of the fireball they pour through the remains of the barricade and attack—they give no quarter. A horseman spurs his horse towards you, his lance levelled at your chest.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to stand and fight the horseman, <a href="sect333.htm">turn to 333</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to run back to the watchtower, <a href="sect107.htm">turn to 107</a>.</p></body></html>
