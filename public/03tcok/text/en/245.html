Even the Kanu-dogs wrinkle their noses in disgust and shy away from the evil smell.</p><p>When Irian appears at your side with a skinning knife, you wince at the thought of skinning this dreadful creature.

You cannot believe your eyes when he scoops out handfuls of thick oil from inside the skin and smears it all over his face and body. ‘Baknar oil,’ he shouts enthusiastically. ‘Keeps you dry and warm. Better than fur for keeping out the Kalte ice.’ He offers you a handful of the vile oil.</p><figure>
