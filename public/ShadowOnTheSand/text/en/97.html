There is no lock, but, instinctively, you avoid opening the lid with your hands in case it is booby-trapped. Nearby, you notice a wooden bucket and a ladle. Using the ladle, you lever open the chest and push back the lid. The chest itself is not booby-trapped, but your caution was well placed; coiled on a bed of jewel-encrusted maces lies a Yas, a non-poisonous but very large Vassagonian snake. A red forked tongue flicks out of its yellow head as it prepares to defend its valuable bed.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to attack the Yas, <a href="sect194.htm">turn to 194</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to flick shut the lid and leave the armoury by the north door, <a href="sect14.htm">turn to 14</a>.</p></body></html>
