<html><body><p>A narrow corridor faces you, which is lit by the orange light of the setting sun filtering down from small open windows set high above in the patterned walls. The air is filled with the sound of running feet, for the Grand Palace is now on full alert. The palace guards and the evil Drakkarim are bent on finding and killing you, for their own lives will be forfeit if they fail.</p><p>You reach a door that opens onto an outside balcony. A stair descends to a bridge that connects a needle-like tower of white marble to the main palace. The stair itself continues past the bridge, disappearing down towards the palace gardens far below. You see no soldiers, either on the bridge or in the gardens.</p><figure>
