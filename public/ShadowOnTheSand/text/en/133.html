The number and varying size of the prints suggest that a whole colony of these loathsome creatures inhabit the tunnel. You decide it is far too dangerous to continue in this direction, and instead climb a narrow stairway that leads to a chamber above the tunnel. Here at least it is dry, although the foul sewer gas permeates everything. You follow a narrow passage, first to the west and then south, but your heart sinks as you see a dead end looming ahead.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to search for a hidden exit, <a href="sect33.htm">turn to 33</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you decide to turn around and return to the walkway, <a href="sect64.htm">turn to 64</a>.</p></body></html>
