<html><body><p>Hurrying down the steps and away from the Bath Hall, you enter the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">‘Saadi-tas-Ouda’</i>: the Square of the Dead. Jet-black flagstones cover the square, each with a long iron spike set deep into its centre. From the Bath Hall steps, the square resembles the back of a massive iron porcupine, but when you reach the base of the steps, you realize that the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Saadi-tas-Ouda</i> is in fact far more sinister.</p><p>Stuck on top of each spike is a human skull—all that remains of pirates, murderers, traitors, and thieves who have been sentenced to death. The grisly display serves as a warning to others never to defy the law of the Zakhan.</p><p>As you reach the far side of the square, you brush against a spike. Fresh blood is smeared across the arm of your tunic, staining it dark red. You raise your eyes, cursing at your misfortune, but you are shocked into silence by the sight before you.</p><figure>

</figure><p>Impaled upon the sharp iron pole is the head of the Vassagonian envoy. To either side are the heads of all the galley crew. On each of their foreheads is freshly branded one word—TRAITOR. Fear wells up inside you; turning your face away from the sightless eyes, you run into the crowded streets of the <i xml:lang="x-vassagonian">Mikarum</i>, the district where the spice and herb merchants live.</p><p>At the end of a narrow, winding street, you reach a junction. Opposite is a shop with a bright red sign above the door:</p><p class="choice">If you need the Oede herb, <a href="sect68.htm">turn to 68</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you do not need this herb, but still decide to enter the shop, <a href="sect154.htm">turn to 154</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to continue along in a new alleyway that heads off towards the Grand Palace, <a href="sect179.htm">turn to 179</a>.</p></body></html>
