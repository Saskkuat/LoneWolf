<html><body><p>The door is unlocked, and for a moment your heart sinks; if this room is the Imperial Apothecary where the Oede herb is kept, why is the door not locked and guarded? Anxiously you slip inside and survey the interior.</p><p>It seems to be an apothecary. Glass retorts bubble and steam over jets of blue flame, and strange fluids pass back and forth through a crazy maze of tubes and tunnels. Hundreds of herb jars line the far wall, and ten large copper urns, each full of rainbow-coloured powder, hang suspended from the soot-blackened ceiling. You begin searching through the herb jars, and suddenly you discover why the door was left unlocked. Creeping slowly towards you is the cat-like creature that guards the apothecary. Its eyes glow with a vivid green luminescence as it prepares to strike.</p><p class="combat">Elix: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 17   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 32</p><p>If you have ever fought an Elix before, add 2 to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of this fight.
