The mine is very dark but you are quick to notice that unlit torches hang from the walls at regular intervals. You each take a torch and light them before continuing. In the dim glow you discover footprints leading to a collapsed section of the tunnel. They continue all the way to the top of a huge mound of earth, which reaches almost to the ceiling, leaving only a small gap.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to climb the mound and squeeze through the gap, <a href="sect254.htm">turn to 254</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you decide to call off the search, you can return to the surface, remount your horses, and descend the hill track by <a href="sect191.htm">turning to 191</a>.</p></body></html>
