<html><body><p>The bandit horseman pursues you, his lance speeding closer and closer behind you. You are running flat out, and it is too late to dodge the Sommlending soldier who now stands in your way, his bow drawn ready to fire.</p><p>‘Dive!’ he screams at you, and instinctively you obey his bold command. Almost simultaneously, he releases the bowstring. The bandit is barely feet away when the steel-tipped arrow penetrates his visor and erupts from the rear of his helmet like a skewer through an apple. The charging horse crashes to the ground throwing its dead rider at your side. You open your mouth to shout your thanks, but before you can speak the soldier turns and hurries away to the barricade.</p><figure>
