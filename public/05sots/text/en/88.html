<html><body><p>The poster is written from right to left in Vassagonian script. The time you spent learning the language aboard the galley was well spent, for you have little difficulty in translating the proclamation:</p><p>His most illustrious majesty, Zakhan Moudalla the Exalted, has passed into the realm of the Majhan. May his spirit never die! By the grace of the Council of Kadi, the Funtal of Kara Kala, and the Judicar of Barrakeesh, it is decreed that Kimah, Emir of Ferufezan, Protector of the Dry Main, shall by right claim the throne of Vassagonia. Through the unity of the Seven Cities, he will lead his people to greatness.</p><p>Long may he reign!</p><p>A scuffle breaks out at the end of the passage as a handful of Sharnazim try to push their way through the crowd. In the confusion a fruit stall is overturned, and its owner curses the clumsy soldiers at the top of his voice. Then there is a sudden silenceâ€”the luckless man has been beheaded for his insolence.</p><figure>
