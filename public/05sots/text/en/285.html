<html><body><p>As you turn and sprint along the passage, a terrible roar of hatred and rage fills the hall: ‘Kill him!’</p><p>You glance back. The Drakkarim are unsheathing their black swords, eager to obey their master’s command. You race down some stairs, through a silver archway, and along a balcony that overlooks the lower palace.</p><p>The Akataz is nearly upon you; you feel its fetid breath on your legs. Instinctively you dodge aside at the very second it leaps. It crashes muzzle first into a marble pillar. A howl of pain leaves its broken mouth as you step forward and strike a death-blow; it will never attack again.</p><p>You glimpse the grim silhouette of Darklord Haakon in the hall below, his spiked fist raised. A Drakkar appears as if from nowhere and advances, a sword held high above his skull-like helm. There is a deafening crack as a bolt of blue lightning streaks from a stone in the Darklord’s hand and comes hurtling towards you. The Drakkar lunges and wounds your arm (you lose 2 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points), but he now stands in the path of the bolt. In a flash of light, the Drakkar is gone, leaving only cinders and the rotten odour of scorched flesh behind.</p><figure>
