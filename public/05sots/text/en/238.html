You race down a stairway, through an arch of silver and along a balcony overlooking the lower palace.</p><p>You glimpse the silhouette of Darklord Haakon in the hall below, his spiked fist raised. A Drakkar appears from nowhere and leaps at you, his sword raised high above his skull-like helm. There is a deafening crack, and a bolt of blue lightning streaks from a stone in the Darklordâ€™s hand and hurtles towards you. The Drakkar lunges and wounds your forearm (you lose 1 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point), but he is now standing in the path of the bolt. In a flash of light, the Drakkar is gone; only cinders and the rotten odour of scorched flesh remain.</p><p>At the end of the balcony you see another arch and a staircase.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to escape through the arch, <a href="sect381.htm">turn to 381</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to escape by the stairs, <a href="sect317.htm">turn to 317</a>.</p></body></html>
