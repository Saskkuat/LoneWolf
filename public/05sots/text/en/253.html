<html><body><p>Suddenly, the pain subsides, but a new horror is taking shape before your eyes. Out of the darkness, a green whorl of vapour is forming slowly into the shape of a glistening, serpent-like monster. A grey mist issues forth from the Darklord’s mouth, floating towards the core of this horror, infusing it with the power of death. The serpent writhes and convulses as the grey mist fills its body, changing it from a dream-like illusion into a living nightmare. Two pinpoints of crimson glow from its eyes, as it slithers towards you.</p><p class="combat">Dhorgaan: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 20   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 40</p><p>If you possess a Jewelled Mace, you may add 5 to your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> for the duration of the combat, for it is an enchanted weapon, especially effective against such a creature.</p><figure>
