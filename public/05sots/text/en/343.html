A handful of Drakkarim are scattered as if they were rag dolls as the great black bird emerges from the pen and takes to the sky. You catch a glimpse of a Drakkar, his death-mask slashed in two by the bird’s razor-sharp talons, as he pitches from the landing platform and tumbles to his death in the palace gardens far below.</p><figure>

Soon, you have passed over the city wall and are heading out towards the shimmering salt-flats of Lake Inrahim. The land below is bathed in beautiful orange twilight, as the sun slowly sinks behind the Dahir Mountains to the west. Elated by your escape, you throw back your head and give voice to a triumphant yell that is carried away on the chill evening wind.</p><p>As if in answer to your cry, an echoing chorus of shrieks pierce the sky. Fear returns to your heart as you catch sight of a flock of Kraan, hideous leathery-winged fliers. Each carries a Drakkarim warrior on its back. They are over a mile behind you, but they are quickly closing the gap. Less than an hour of light remains; if you can evade them a little longer, you may be able to lose them when night falls.</p><p>You must decide in which direction to fly, for you are now above the centre of Lake Inrahim—consult the <a href="map.htm">map</a> before making your decision.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to steer the Itikar south towards the Dahir Pass, <a href="sect264.htm">turn to 264</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to head east towards the town of Chula, <a href="sect244.htm">turn to 244</a>.</p></body></html>
