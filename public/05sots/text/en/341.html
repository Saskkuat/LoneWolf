(Mark the Key as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>). At the entrance, you see a crowd of Drakkarim and palace guards rushing across the bridgeâ€”certain death awaits you there. You continue down the spiral stairs towards a dim light below.</p><p>A small fire, over which roasts a chicken on a spit, illuminates a guardroom at the base of the tower. On the back of a wrought-iron chair hangs a Canteen of Water and a Broadsword. You may take either or both of these items if you wish, but remember to mark them on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. (The Canteen is a Backpack Item.)</p><p>You hear the enemy thundering down the stairs; they will soon be upon you. However, a heavy wooden door in the north wall offers you another chance of escape.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to escape from the guard room by this door, <a href="sect246.htm">turn to 246</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to stand and fight, <a href="sect231.htm">turn to 231</a>.</p></body></html>
