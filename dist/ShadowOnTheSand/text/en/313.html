<html><body><p>Below the bell-tower you see a line of Itikar pens, each with its own circular landing platform. Itikar are a breed of huge black birds that nest in eyries high in the peaks of the Dahir and Vakar Mountains. The Vassagonians have long since tamed these giants of the skies, using them as winged mounts for their army leaders, their scouts, couriers, and envoys.</p><p>An Itikar and rider swoop down out of the reddening sky and alight upon the platform nearest to the bell-tower. Slaves hurl a rope to the rider, who in turn fixes it to a saddle ring before he jumps to the ground. The Itikar caws and beats its huge wings as it is slowly winched into the pen by a hidden capstan.</p><p>The rider and the slaves leave the platform; there is now only one sentry on guard at the pen. If you can overpower him, you can make your escape on the back of the giant bird.</p><p class="choice">If you possess a Blowpipe and Sleep Dart, <a href="sect325.htm">turn to 325</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you do not have these items, <a href="sect282.htm">turn to 282</a>.</p></body></html>
