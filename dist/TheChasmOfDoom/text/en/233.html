<html><body><p>Your rest is disturbed by the anxious shout of the night guard: ‘Awake! Awake! We’re under attack!’</p><p>Throwing back their blankets, your men leap to their feet, peering through the teeming rain at the shadowy silhouette of horsemen circling the ruins. Suddenly an arrow whistles through the darkness. Your lookout screams and falls to his knees. ‘Form a circle,’ you shout. ‘Keep behind cover!’</p><p>The rangers gather swords and shields and press themselves against the wet temple marble for protection. The sound of metal-shod boots on stone makes you spin around. A dozen warriors dressed in shiny red armour are clambering across the broken pillars. Two rangers run to block their advance, but they are felled by one sweep of the warrior leader’s broadsword. Then the warrior sees you and quickens his pace. His bloodied sword is raised to strike again. You cannot evade combat and must fight the warrior to the death.</p><p class="combat">Bandit Warrior: <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> 17   <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> 26</p><p class="choice">If you win, <a href="sect312.htm">turn to 312</a>.</p></body></html>
