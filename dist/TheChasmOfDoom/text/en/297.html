This is the Ruanon Bridge: you recognize its stout black timbers and the dark waters of the River Xane that flow beneath. On the far side of the bridge lie the fire-blackened ruins of an inn and the unmistakable silhouette of bandit horsemen. At the entrance to the bridge is a white signpost pointing across the bridge to the south.</p><p>You know it would be suicidal to attempt to cross the bridge: the bandit horsemen each carry a heavy crossbow slung from their saddle.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to try to cross the river further upstream to the west, <a href="sect113.htm">turn to 113</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to try to cross the river downstream, to the east, <a href="sect252.htm">turn to 252</a>.</p></body></html>
