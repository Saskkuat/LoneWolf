However, in spite of the damage, you find enough proof from the ashes to confirm your suspicions. This is the wreck of a Sommlending cavalry wagon; one of three that left for Ruanon with Captain D’Val’s troop over a month ago.</p><p>As you stand in the wagon, brushing the ash from your hands, one of your men suddenly cries out in pain. You glance up in time to see him fall from his horse, a disc of sharp steel embedded in his chest. ‘Ambush! Take cover!’ you shout, as more of the deadly discs whistle out of the trees to claim their victims. Frightened horses gallop in all directions, your men desperately clinging to the reins. The hidden attackers vanish as quickly as they came, but not before three of your men are left dead upon the highway.</p><p>After burying your dead, you must decide on the best course of action; for now only four men remain at your side and the hidden enemy may return at any time to finish their evil handiwork.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to continue along the highway, riding full speed for Ruanon, <a href="sect297.htm">turn to 297</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to avoid the main highway and continue by the eastern track, <a href="sect15.htm">turn to 15</a>.</p></body></html>
