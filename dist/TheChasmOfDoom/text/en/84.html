The flicker of a log fire is all that illuminates this foul-smelling hovel, yet it sheds enough light for you to see the clutter of charts and strange instruments that crowd the hut. The man slowly raises his gaze from a large crystal sphere and bids you sit opposite him.</p><p>‘You know my name—how?’ you ask warily.</p><p>‘The stars foretold our meeting long ago, Lone Wolf,’ he replies, slowly passing his withered old hands around the sphere. ‘Be not alarmed by my knowledge for I wish only to aid you.’ He produces a small scroll of parchment from within his robe, and he hands it to you. Upon the scroll is written the following verse:</p><figure>

You lean across the cluttered table to awaken him and are shocked to see your hand pass straight through his body. Gradually his image begins to fade. Within seconds he has disappeared completely.</p><p>You place the Scroll in your pocket. (Mark this as a Special Item on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.) You quickly leave the hut, pausing only to wipe the cold sweat from your brow.</p><p class="choice">
