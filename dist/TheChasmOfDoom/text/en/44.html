One of the robed men shatters a small flask as he falls to the ground. A search of the bodies reveals 12 Gold Crowns and enough food for two Meals. If you wish to keep any of these items, remember to mark them on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. You notice that both of the men wear amulets on chains around their necks. They are wooden and shaped in the likeness of fish.</p><figure>
