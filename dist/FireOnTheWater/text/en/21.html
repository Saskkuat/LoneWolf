The crowd soon disperses and the tavern is a bustle of noise and activity once more. The other card players retrieve their gold from the table and leave the remainder for you.</p><p>To find out how much has been left on the table, pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. (In this instance, 0 = 10 instead of zero.) Now multiply this number by 3. The total is the number of Gold Crowns that are on the table. You may also take the Card Sharpâ€™s Dagger if you wish. Remember to mark all the items on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p><p>As the body is being dragged outside, you walk to the bar and call for the innkeeper. You press a Gold Crown into his hand and ask for a room for the night.</p><p class="choice">
