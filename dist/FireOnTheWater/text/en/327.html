<html><body><p>You are slowly walking back along the cobbled street, trying to think of the best course of action, when a young boy approaches you. ‘I can get you into the harbour, mister,’ he says, ‘but it’ll cost you.’</p><p>He produces an envelope containing a sheaf of official-looking papers. ‘These’ll get you a red pass at the port watchtower. All yours for only 6 Gold Crowns.’
</p><p>If you wish to buy the documents, pay the boy 6 Gold Crowns. If you refuse them, he will soon lose interest in you and will disappear. When you have made your decision, you return to the port watchtower.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to enter, <a href="sect318.htm">turn to 318</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you would rather walk back along the tree-lined avenue to the city hall and enquire how you can reach the consulate of Sommerlund, <a href="sect84.htm">turn to 84</a>.</p><section id="footnotes">

<p> If you do not have 6 Gold Crowns, the boy will sell the papers to you for however many you have, including 0 Crowns. These papers need not be marked on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (and thus do not require a Backpack to carry them in). Without these papers, it would be possible to wander endlessly in Port Bax.</p>
