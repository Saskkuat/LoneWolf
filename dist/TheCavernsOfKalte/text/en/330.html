After ascending over two hundred steps, you arrive at a long passage which ends at a balcony. Thirty feet below, you see Vonotar the Traitor standing in front of two Ice Barbarian warriors. He is placing a gold bracelet upon the wrist of one of them, and is unaware of your presence. There are no stairs from here to the chamber below, but there is a door at the end of the balcony.</p><figure>
