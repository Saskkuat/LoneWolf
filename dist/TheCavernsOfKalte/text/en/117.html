The huge crystal-towered stronghold is a wondrous sight, made all the more marvellous because it appears to hover upside down upon a large cloud. ‘Kalte mirage,’ says Dyce. ‘There’s no dust in the air here—the land is reflected in the clouds. That’s Ikaya, but the real fortress is over the horizon. It cannot be more than forty miles away now.’ Dyce grabs a spade and starts to dig out the Kanu-dogs that have been buried by snow. You wake the others and eat a meal before setting off once more.</p><p>It is midday when you reach the edge of a deep gorge. It is over forty feet wide, and there appears to be no way of crossing it. You are forced to travel along the gorge to the east. Eventually, after three miles, you discover a narrow ice bridge. However, the centre of the bridge is frighteningly thin and narrow: it looks incapable of supporting the weight of a loaded sledge.</p><figure>
