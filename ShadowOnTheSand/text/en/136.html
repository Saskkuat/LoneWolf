You see a stair descending to a small chamber where a black-robed soldier is guarding a pair of iron gates. Through the bars you can see rows of weapons and suits of armour stacked in long racks. A sign fixed to the bars says:</p><p class="choice">If you have the Kai Discipline of Camouflage, <a href="sect186.htm">turn to 186</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you want to attack the guard, <a href="sect178.htm">turn to 178</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you want to close the door and take the other passage, <a href="sect93.htm">turn to 93</a>.</p></body></html>
