They eye you suspiciously but are obviously reassured by your mastery of their language. You pretend to be a merchant whose goods have been confiscated and ask to be allowed to plead your case to the Judicar of Barrakeesh. The guards chuckle to themselves, and then demand two items from your Backpack before they allow you into the Grand Palace. They wink at each other, for they know that the Judicar never returns confiscated cargoes. They think you will be thrown in the palace cells for your insolence, like every other aggrieved merchant who has tried to plead for justice.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to give the guards what they demand, erase any two Backpack Items (except Meals) from your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. You may now pass through the gate and enter the palace gardens. <a href="sect137.htm">Turn to 137</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you do not or cannot give the guards two Backpack Items, you must leave the gate and search for some other means of entering the palace. <a href="sect49.htm">Turn to 49</a>.</p></body></html>
