Suddenly, in the gloom you see the shape of a large and hideous, four-legged creature. It leaps at you, its red eyes glowering and its fanged mouth open to reveal a long barbed tongue, lashing towards your face.</p><p>‘Agh! A Kalkoth!’ screams Fenor. He rushes to your side, holding a sword high in his hand. He attempts to strike at the creature’s tongue. But the creature is already upon you, and you must fight it.</p><p>In spite of Fenor’s attack the beast only seems to be interested in you. Fenor does not receive any wounds as he stabs at it from behind.</p><p>Deduct an additional 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points from the Kalkoth’s <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> point total for each round of combat you fight.
