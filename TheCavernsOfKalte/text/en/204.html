Grabbing a torch from the pile of equipment, you light it and leave the tent.</p><p>The wind has become much stronger since you first made camp. It whips the fine snow into small whirlwinds that sting your eyes. A moving shadow to your right betrays the Baknar as it lopes towards you. It is preparing to pounce when it sees your guttering torch and shrieks in terror. Seconds later, it has disappeared into the darkness.

To ensure that the Baknar does not attack again, you all take it in turns to sit watch that evening, torches and weapons at the ready.</p><p class="choice">
