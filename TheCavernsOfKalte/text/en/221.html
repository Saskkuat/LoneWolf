<html><body><p>The corridor in which you now stand is far warmer than the icy cavern outside. For the first time in many days, you can lower the hood of your cloak and remove your mittens without risking frostbite.</p><p>You notice that the stone passage ascends to a landing where another passage branches off to the east. Mâ€™lare bowls hang at regular intervals along the arched ceiling, their unnatural light illuminating the carved walls.</p><p>As you approach the landing, you notice an archway leading into a small room beyond. A strange sight meets your eyes. Ragged furs, pottery shards, and the debris of hundreds of years seem to have been thrown into this chamber. A large lever protrudes from the wall beside the archway.</p><figure>
