<html><body><p>As the vile Akraa’Neonor quivers and dies, Vonotar breaks off mind combat and runs back towards the Brumalmarc throne.</p><p>Loi-Kymar is badly shaken but he has survived the ordeal. He quickly joins you at the edge of the moat and casts a handful of herbs down into the darkness. Within seconds, a mass of vines and creepers coil upwards to form a bridge. You are halfway across the bridge when Vonotar suddenly reappears, a crystal rod held high in his hand. He takes aim at the mass of creepers and a chilling cone of frost hurtles from the rod’s tip.</p><figure>
