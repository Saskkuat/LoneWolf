<html><body><p>This street seems dirtier and smellier than the one you have just been down. The cluttered window of a shop to your left catches your attention. In the window are many useful items, all of which bear a price tag.</p><p>You may enter and purchase any of the above items. Remember to mark them on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>. When you have completed your purchases, you continue your way along Sage Street, towards the Ragadorn Bridge. This bridge is the only connection between the east and west sides of the port and you push your way through the crowds of people and carts. You find yourself in a rubbish-strewn thoroughfare known as East Trade Lane.</p><figure>
