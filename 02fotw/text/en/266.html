The prices of his weapons are displayed on a wooden board above the counter:</p><p>You may purchase any of the above weapons if you have enough money to do so. The weaponsmith will also buy any Weapons that you may already have for 1 Gold Crown less than the price shown on his wooden board. Mark any necessary changes on your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> before bidding him goodnight and returning to the street.</p><p>At the end of Oxyoke Way, on your right you find a large stable and coach station. It is now very dark and you must find somewhere to spend the night. Climbing a ladder at the side of the building, you spend a comfortable night hidden in the hay-loft.</p><p class="choice">
