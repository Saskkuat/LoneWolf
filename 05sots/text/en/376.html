Some children are tossing hollowed-out larnuma fruits at him, trying to catch them upon the tip of his spear. Opposite the barracks is a tavern with a line of saddled douggas tied to a rail near the main door. The braying of these sand-horses rivals the sound of revelry drifting from the tavern door.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to enter the tavern, <a href="sect351.htm">turn to 351</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to continue along the street towards the Dougga Market, <a href="sect202.htm">turn to 202</a>.</p></body></html>
