Visibility diminishes with each passing minute until, finally, you can see no further than the outriggers. You feel uneasy; if the <cite>Skyrider</cite> veers but a fraction off course, you will be smashed to pieces against the mountainside.</p><p>‘Do not worry, Lone Wolf,’ says Nolrim, the dwarf with the velvet satchel. ‘The captain will see us through.’</p><p>Banedon stands with his hand resting lightly on the glowing crystal, relaxed as if in a trance. His eyes are closed and a crackle of energy, like fine white lightning, traces an intricate pattern over his forehead and temples.</p><p>The dwarf leads you to the cabin at the rear of the craft where the crew are excitedly recounting their victory over the Kraan-riders. They are seated about a table cluttered with plates of steaming food and jugs of foaming ale. The rich smell of spiced meat and Bor-brew fills your nostrils, reminding you of how ravenously hungry you are.</p><p>You make short work of the meat and marrow placed before you. Restore 3 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. However, you are unsure about accepting a jug of ale; Bor-brew is so strong that in many cities of Magnamund it has been banned for fear of the havoc it can cause.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to accept a jug of the notorious ale, <a href="sect392.htm">turn to 392</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you decide to decline the offer, <a href="sect283.htm">turn to 283</a>.</p></body></html>
