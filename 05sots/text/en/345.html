There is a deafening crack as a bolt of blue lightning streaks from a stone in the Darklord’s hand and hurtles towards you. You dive for cover behind the body of the Drakkar as the bolt explodes. In a flash of light, the Drakkar is gone. Only cinders and the rotten odour of scorched flesh remain.</p><p>You scramble to your feet and sprint along the passage. Another bolt hurtles from the hall, tearing into the ceiling with shattering effect. Splinters of razor-sharp marble whistle down, slashing your cloak and tunic. You race down some stairs, through a silver archway and along a balcony that overlooks the lower palace. A peal of bells and the crunch of iron-shod boots echo in your ears—the Zakhan has sounded the alarm, his guards close in on every side.</p><p>At the end of the balcony are another arch and a staircase: both look deserted.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to escape through the arch, <a href="sect381.htm">turn to 381</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to race up the stairs, <a href="sect317.htm">turn to 317</a>.</p></body></html>
