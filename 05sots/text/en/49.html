Slowly, a bold plan begins to take shape in your mind.

There is a broad avenue where a bridge of gnarled old wood and metal curves over the street, and here, beneath the wooden arch, you lie in wait for your prey.</p><p>Your chance soon arrives; a black-robed rider enters the avenue and spurs his horse along the street. He will have to pass beneath the arch. You prepare to pounce.</p><p>Pick a number from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>.
