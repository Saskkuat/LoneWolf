<html><body><p>A forge has been constructed in the centre of a massive circular chamber, its funnel-like chimney stretching up to the roof. The heat had become unbearable long ago, but now you feel as if you have walked straight into a raging furnace.</p><p>Two men, naked except for small loin-cloths, work the bellows that feed the forge. Sweat pours from their bodies, and they frequently stop to gulp ladlefuls of water from a trough set in the stone floor. An armourer hammers a strip of red-hot iron at an anvil close to the flames. He is massive; his huge, muscled shoulders and powerful chest are as wide as the other two men put together.</p><p>The bellows men stop work and leave the chamber; one by the door in the north wall, the other by the door in the west wall. The big man continues to hammer at the anvil.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to follow the man who left by the north door, <a href="sect11.htm">turn to 11</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to follow the man who left by the west door, <a href="sect146.htm">turn to 146</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to attack the armourer working at the anvil, <a href="sect190.htm">turn to 190</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to leave the chamber and retrace your steps along the corridor to take the other passage, <a href="sect30.htm">turn to 30</a>.</p></body></html>
