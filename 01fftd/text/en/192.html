You are saved from certain death when your horse jumps at the approaching beasts, knocking them both to the ground. You lash out at the Giak and open a large wound in his head … and then suddenly, as if by a miracle, you’re through and racing on down the highway, clear of the rest of the pack.</p><p>But a shadow follows you.

Its target is you.</p><p class="choice">If you veer off the highway towards the cover of the trees, <a href="sect171.htm">turn to 171</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you press on regardless of the Kraan and gallop flat out down the highway, <a href="sect120.htm">turn to 120</a>.</p></body></html>
