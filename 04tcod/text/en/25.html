<html><body><p>After journeying through the rich wheat fields of southern Sommerlund, the view that lies before you now looks especially bleak and colourless. The landscape is flat and desolate, only relieved here and there by a ragged copse of stunted firs or mound of broken earth. (You have entered the Wildlands south of the Pass of Moytura and cannot use the Kai Discipline of Hunting to hunt for food in this desolate area.) During the afternoon, storm clouds gather above the peaks of the Durncrag Mountains to the west, and the roll of distant thunder warns of imminent rain. It is early evening when your scouts find the ruins of an old temple, less than a mile from the highway.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to set up camp for the night in the shelter of the ruins, <a href="sect290.htm">turn to 290</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to avoid the temple and continue, <a href="sect141.htm">turn to 141</a>.</p></body></html>
