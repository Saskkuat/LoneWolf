<html><body><p>Raising the hood of your Kai cloak, you crouch in the bottom of an empty ore wagon and wait with bated breath. Through a gap in the wood you can see a haggard procession of men shuffling towards you. An escort of bandit warriors pushes them forward, beating any who falter or slip out of line. You feel a sudden jolt as your wagon is pushed along the tunnel and glance up to see a sweat-streaked face peering down at you. ‘Run left when I say “Go”,’ whispers the face which then disappears over the edge of the wagon.</p><p>As the wagon emerges from the tunnel, sunlight suddenly floods over you. Through the crack you can now see your destination; the wagons are being shunted onto a timber gantry where the track ends some fifty feet above a huge mound of ore. Your observations are cut short by a hissed command: ‘Go!’</p><p class="choice">If you wish to leap from the wagon and run to the left, <a href="sect27.htm">turn to 27</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you wish to jump from the wagon and run to the right, <a href="sect144.htm">turn to 144</a>.</p><p class="choice">If you decide to ignore the command and stay where you are, <a href="sect294.htm">turn to 294</a>.</p></body></html>
